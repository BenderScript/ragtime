### Module 2: Understanding Retrieval in AI
#### Theory: Explanation of Information Retrieval, Its Importance in AI, and Overview of Retrieval Systems

##### Understanding Information Retrieval

Information Retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images, or sounds. It involves the retrieval of information that is relevant to specific user queries from large collections of data, like databases, websites, or document repositories.

#### Importance of Information Retrieval in AI

1. **Foundation for Many AI Applications**: IR is fundamental in various AI applications like search engines, recommendation systems, and data mining. These systems rely on efficient IR to provide relevant, accurate, and timely information.

2. **Enhancing User Experience**: In the context of AI, IR systems are designed to understand and interpret user queries, often in natural language, and fetch the most relevant information. This capability is crucial for enhancing user interaction and experience with AI systems.

3. **Data Organization and Accessibility**: IR plays a vital role in organizing vast amounts of data and making it accessible. It enables AI systems to sift through large datasets to find meaningful patterns, trends, or specific information.

4. **Supporting Decision Making**: In business and research, IR aids in decision-making by providing relevant data and insights. For instance, AI-driven market analysis tools use IR to gather and interpret market data for strategic planning.

5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration**: IR techniques are closely linked with NLP, as understanding and processing human language is crucial for effective retrieval. This integration is key in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other AI applications involving language understanding.

#### Overview of Retrieval Systems

1. **Search Engines**: The most common form of IR systems. They index and retrieve web pages based on user queries. Examples include Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

2. **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: These systems retrieve data from structured databases. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and retrieving data.

3. **Document Retrieval Systems**: These are specialized in retrieving parts of documents, entire documents, or collections of documents. Libraries and academic databases are examples.

4. **Multimedia Retrieval Systems**: They focus on retrieving various forms of multimedia content like images, videos, and audio. They often use metadata or content-based retrieval methods.

5. **Enterprise Search Systems**: Used in businesses to search for information within the organization. They index internal documents, emails, and other data sources.

6. **Recommendation Systems**: Though primarily for suggesting items to users, they rely heavily on IR to filter and present items (like books, movies, products) relevant to a user's interests.

Each of these systems uses different algorithms and techniques tailored to their specific type of data and user needs. The effectiveness of an IR system is often measured by its relevance (the accuracy of the results to the query) and recall (the ability of the system to retrieve all relevant items).#### Practical
- Simple Python script for basic information retrieval.

```python
# Simple Python script for basic information retrieval
# Here, we use a fixed list of documents for simplicity

documents = [
    "The sky is blue.",
    "Apples are sweet.",
    "The ocean is vast."
]

query = "What is the color of the sky?"

# Simple retrieval function
def retrieve_info(query_param, doc_list):
    for doc in doc_list:
        if query_param.lower() in doc.lower():
            return doc
    return "No relevant document found."

def main():
    result = retrieve_info(query, documents)
    print(result)

# Call main function directly
main()
```

### Module 3 : RAG Concepts and Applications

#### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI model that combines two key components of AI: retrieval (information search and extraction) and generation (creating coherent text based on the retrieved information). RAG models are designed to improve the quality and relevance of generated text by first consulting a vast repository of information (like documents or databases) before producing an answer.

#### Components of RAG

1. **Retrieval System**:
   - **Function**: Searches through a large dataset or document repository to find information relevant to a given query.
   - **Techniques Used**: Often involves indexing techniques, search algorithms, and sometimes machine learning models to understand the query and retrieve pertinent data.

2. **Generative Model**:
   - **Function**: Takes the retrieved information and uses it to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.
   - **Common Models Used**: Language models like GPT-3, which can generate natural language text based on the input they receive.

#### How RAG Combines Retrieval and Generation

1. **Query Processing**: The process begins with a user query or prompt.
2. **Retrieval Phase**: The retrieval system searches its dataset to find information related to the query. This can include documents, snippets, or structured data.
3. **Integration**: The retrieved information is then fed into the generative model, along with the original query.
4. **Generation Phase**: The generative model uses both the query and the retrieved information to produce a detailed, informed response. This response is typically more accurate and relevant than what a standalone generative model could produce.

#### Diagrams Illustrating RAG

To aid in visualizing the RAG process, I will create two diagrams:

1. **Overall Flow of RAG**: This diagram will show the flow from query to response, highlighting the retrieval and generation phases.
2. **RAG System Architecture**: This diagram will depict the internal components of a RAG model, showcasing how retrieval and generative models are interconnected.

    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    # Initialize OpenAI's language model with the API key
    llm = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    # Document database for contextual retrieval
    documents = {
        "machine learning": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications "
                            "to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do "
                            "so.",

        # Additional documents can be added here
    }

    # Contextual retrieval function
    def contextual_retrieve(query_text, doc_dict):
        # Extract context from the query
        context = query_text.lower()

        # Find the most relevant document based on the context
        best_match = None
        best_match_score = 0  # Simple score based on keyword overlap

        for key, content in doc_dict.items():
            match_score = sum(word in content.lower() for word in context.split())
            if match_score > best_match_score:
                best_match = content
                best_match_score = match_score

        return best_match if best_match else "Relevant information not found."

    # Function to generate a response using RAG-like process

     ```
   - **Relevance**: Crucial for deploying RAG models in production where performance, speed, and resource management are key considerations.

#### Practical: Implementing Advanced RAG Applications

**Objective**:  
The goal is to provide hands-on experience with advanced RAG techniques, particularly focusing on the customization of retrieval sources based on query context. This exercise demonstrates enhancing the relevance and accuracy of responses by tailoring the retrieval process to different query types using Langchain and OpenAI's models.

**Environment Setup**:
- Ensure you have a Python environment with Langchain installed.
- Access to OpenAI's API, secured with an API key.

**Example 1: Customizing Retrieval Sources Based on Query Context**

In this example, you'll develop a system that dynamically selects the most appropriate information source based on the query's context. This simulates advanced RAG systems where the retrieval component understands the context or category of the query to fetch the most relevant information.

**Example 1: Customizing Retrieval Sources**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

def context_based_retrieval(query, data_sources):
    """
    Advanced retrieval function that selects a data source based on the query's context.
    """
    query_context = analyze_query_context(query)
    
    selected_source = data_sources.get(query_context, "general")
    retrieved_info = selected_source.get(query, "Specific information not found.")

    return retrieved_info

def analyze_query_context(query):
    """
    Function to analyze the context of the query and decide which data source to use.
    """
    # Simulate context analysis logic
    if "history" in query.lower():
        return "historical"
    elif "current" in query.lower():
        return "current_events"
    else:
        return "general"

def generate_contextual_response(query, data_sources, language_model):
    """
    Generates a response using context-based retrieval and a language model.
    """
    context_info = context_based_retrieval(query, data_sources)
    combined_input = f"Query: {query}\nContext Info: {context_info}"
    return language_model.generate(prompts=[combined_input], max_tokens=1000).generations[0][0].text

def main():
    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    llm = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    # Different data sources for different contexts
    data_sources = {
        "historical": {
            "world war": "World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.",
            # Add more historical data
        },
        "current_events": {
            "technology trends": "Current technology trends include AI, blockchain, and renewable energy.",
            # Add more current event data
        },
        "general": {
            "elections": "The next US presidential election will be in 2024.",
        }
    }

    query = "What are the key technology trends?"
    response = generate_contextual_response(query, data_sources, llm)

    print("Contextual Response:", response)


main()


```

**Example 2: Integrating Multiple Retrieval Systems**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Function simulating retrieval from a primary source
def primary_retrieve(query, primary_source):
    for key, content in primary_source.items():
        if key in query.lower():
            return content
    return "Primary source info not found."

# Function simulating retrieval from a secondary source
def secondary_retrieve(query, secondary_source):
    for key, content in secondary_source.items():
        if key in query.lower():
            return content
    return "Secondary source info not found."

# Function to generate a response combining multiple retrievals
def generate_response_with_multiple_retrievals(prompt, primary_source, secondary_source, language_model):
    primary_info = primary_retrieve(prompt, primary_source)
    secondary_info = secondary_retrieve(prompt, secondary_source)
    
    combined_input = f"Query: {prompt}\nPrimary Info: {primary_info}\nSecondary Info: {secondary_info}"
    # Assuming a fine-tuned model for the domain of renewable energy
    return language_model.generate(prompts=[combined_input], max_tokens=2000).generations[0][0].text

def main():
    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    llm = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    # Simulating two different data sources
    primary_data_source = {
        "renewable energy": "Renewable energy comes from sources like wind and solar power.",
        "solar power": "Solar power converts sunlight into electricity."
    }
    secondary_data_source = {
        "environmental impact": "Renewable energy sources have a lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuels."
    }

    prompt = "Discuss renewable energy and its environmental impact."
    response = generate_response_with_multiple_retrievals(prompt, primary_data_source, secondary_data_source, llm)

    print("Response with Multiple Retrieval Systems:", response)


main()


```

**Example: Advanced Optimized RAG System for Large-Scale Data**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI


class AdvancedCachedRetriever:
    def __init__(self, large_data_source):
        self.data_source = large_data_source
        self.cache = {}  # Advanced cache

    def efficient_retrieve(self, query):
        if query in self.cache:
            print("Cache hit for query:", query)
            return self.cache[query]

        print("Cache miss for query:", query)
        # Simulate complex retrieval
        retrieved_data = self.data_source.get(query.lower(), "Content not found.")
        if retrieved_data != "Content not found.":
            self.cache[query] = retrieved_data
        return retrieved_data


def generate_optimized_response(query, retriever, language_model):
    retrieved_content = retriever.efficient_retrieve(query)
    combined_input = f"Query: {query}\nRetrieved Info: {retrieved_content}"
    return language_model.generate(prompts=[combined_input], max_tokens=2000).generations[0][0].text


def main():
    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    llm = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    large_data_source = {
        "machine learning trends": "The latest trends in machine learning include deep learning, reinforcement "
                                   "learning, and GANs."
    }

    advanced_retriever = AdvancedCachedRetriever(large_data_source)

    query = "machine learning trends"

    # First query - expected cache miss
    print("\nQuerying first time (expected cache miss):", query)
    response_miss = generate_optimized_response(query, advanced_retriever, llm)
    print("Response:", response_miss)

    # Second query - expected cache hit
    print("\nQuerying second time (expected cache hit):", query)
    response_hit = generate_optimized_response(query, advanced_retriever, llm)
    print("Response (from cache):", response_hit)


main()

```

#### Practical: Time-Sensitive Retrieval in RAG Systems

**Objective**: Demonstrate an optimization technique in a RAG system where the retrieval component is designed to prioritize newer documents in a large corpus based on their timestamps.

**Environment Setup**:
- Python environment with Langchain installed.
- Access to OpenAI API.

**Example: Optimized Time-Sensitive Retrieval in RAG System**

```python
import datetime
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI


class TimeSensitiveRetriever:
    def __init__(self, documents_with_timestamps):
        self.documents = documents_with_timestamps

    def retrieve_recent_document(self, query):
        query_keywords = set(query.lower().split())
        relevant_docs = []
        for doc in self.documents:
            doc_keywords = set(doc['content'].lower().split())
            if query_keywords & doc_keywords:  # Check for keyword overlap
                relevant_docs.append(doc)

        if not relevant_docs:
            return "No relevant document found."

        relevant_docs.sort(key=lambda doc: doc['timestamp'], reverse=True)
        return relevant_docs[0]['content']


def generate_response_with_recent_info(query, retriever, language_model):
    retrieved_content = retriever.retrieve_recent_document(query)
    combined_input = f"Query: {query}\nRecent Info: {retrieved_content}"
    return language_model.generate(prompts=[combined_input], max_tokens=2000).generations[0][0].text


def main():
    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    llm = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    documents = [
        {'content': "Python 3.8 introduces assignment expressions.", 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 14)},
        {'content': "Python 3.9 adds dictionary union operators.", 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2020, 10, 5)},
        # More documents with their release dates
    ]

    retriever = TimeSensitiveRetriever(documents)

    query = "features of Python"
    response = generate_response_with_recent_info(query, retriever, llm)

    print("Response with Recent Information:", response)



main()


```

#### Practical: Contextual Understanding and Relevance Matching

**Objective**: RAG systems must excel at understanding the context of a query and retrieving information that is contextually relevant, not just keyword-based. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques like semantic search can be crucial.

**Environment Setup**:
- Python environment with Langchain installed.
- Access to OpenAI API.

**Example: Contextual Understanding and Relevance Matching**


```python
import re

# Sample Documents
documents = [
    "Python is a widely used high-level programming language, known for its simplicity.",
    "The python snake is a large non-venomous snake found in Africa, Asia, and Australia.",
    "Machine learning involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions, using data."
]


# Function for Good Relevance Matching (Contextual)
def good_relevance_match(query_text):
    query_lower = query_text.lower()

    # Enhanced semantic understanding
    if "programming" in query_lower or "language" in query_lower:
        relevant_docs = [doc for doc in documents if "programming" in doc]
    elif "snake" in query_lower or "wildlife" in query_lower or "african" in query_lower:
        relevant_docs = [doc for doc in documents if "python snake" in doc.lower()]
    else:
        relevant_docs = []

    return relevant_docs if relevant_docs else ["No relevant document found."]


# Function for Bad Relevance Matching (Keyword-based)
def bad_relevance_match(query_text):
    query_keywords = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', query_text.lower()))
    relevant_docs = [doc for doc in documents if query_keywords & set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', doc.lower()))]

    return relevant_docs if relevant_docs else ["No relevant document found."]


# Test the functions
def run_matching_functions():
    queries = ["Python programming features", "African python snake"]

    print("Good Relevance Matching Results:")
    for query in queries:
        print(f"Query: {query}")
        print(good_relevance_match(query), "\n")

    print("Bad Relevance Matching Results:")
    for query in queries:
        print(f"Query: {query}")
        print(bad_relevance_match(query), "\n")


def main():
    run_matching_functions()


main()

```
